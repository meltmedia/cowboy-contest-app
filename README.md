# Cowboy Costume Contest App

A PhoneGap (Cordova 1.5) application that takes a picture of a person along with some validated form fields, and uploads the data to a server. This is the companion app to [Cowboy Contest Site](https://github.com/meltmedia/cowboy-contest-site) which accepts the form data and adds an entry to be voted on through Twitter.
