# Cowboy Costume Contest App

An iPhone only (for now) PhoneGap (Cordova 1.5) application that takes a picture of a person along with some validated form fields, and uploads the data to a server. This is the companion app to [Cowboy Contest Site](https://github.com/meltmedia/cowboy-contest-site) which accepts the form data and adds an entry to be voted on through Twitter.

## Setup Instructions

1. `git clone git@github.com:meltmedia/cowboy-contest-app.git`
2. Follow [PhoneGap iOS installation instructions](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.5.0/guide_getting-started_ios_index.md.html#Getting%20Started%20with%20iOS)
3. Open `cowboy-contest.xcodeproj` in Xcode (tested with 4.3.2)
